This repo consist of minor projects I did in my spare time. Mostly just to stay polished in my Java programming. I tend to get books at Barnes & Noble to stay in touch with different aspects of IT. The book I'm using for most of these programs is the 7th edition Java for Dummies by Barry Burd.

Imported DummiesFrame class to help build a GUI for a couple "Try it Out" practices the author proposed.
