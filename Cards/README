Create an enum to represent the suits in a deck of playing cards (CLUBS, DIAMONDS, HEARTS, and SPADES). 
Create a PlayingCard class. Each playing card has a number (from 1 to 13) and a suit. 
In the numbering scheme, 11 stands for JACK, 12 stands for QUEEN, 13 for KING. 
Write code that creates several cards and displays them on the screen.


This project was later updated to create a static field that keeps track of the number of times the class constructor has been called,
thus having a count on the number of playing cards.
